# Binary Tree

A binary search tree imposes the condition that, for each node, its left descendants are less than or equal to the current node, which is less than the right descendants.

```txt

     8
    / \
   4   10
  / \    \
 2   6    20
```

```txt
No a binary search tree
     8
    / \
   4   10
  / \    \
 2   12   20

 12 > 10
